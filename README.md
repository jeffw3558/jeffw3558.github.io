### Work Experience
Software Development Intern @ Broctagon Fintech Group 
- Built a Python-based testing framework for evaluating Amazon Bedrock LLMs (Claude) across financial NLP tasks; implemented dynamic prompt generation, structured output parsing, and automated failure logging.
- Wrote modular call functions to transmit real-time data to Bedrock models, integrating robust error handling, retry logic, and streaming response support to ensure low-latency performance within a FastAPI backend
- Compared Bedrock LLMs through custom benchmarks and prompt tuning, evaluating performance metrics (accuracy, cost, stability) to guide model selection for regulatory and client-facing use cases.

Software Engineering Intern @ Propulsion AI
- Detected and parsed data for irregularities for analysis and supported LLM-driven testing- relevant to surveillance alert generation
- Integrated GROBID, a machine learning library, with LLMs to enhance PDF processing within a FastAPI framework.
- Wrote a Python call function to send real-time data to language models (LLMs). Implemented dynamic request construction, robust error handling, and response parsing to ensure efficient, real-time data processing and integration into the application. 
- Utilized Docker to containerize GROBID for consistent deployment and scalability.
